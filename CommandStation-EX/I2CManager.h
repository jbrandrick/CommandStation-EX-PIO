/* 
 * Helper class to manage access to the I2C 'Wire' subsystem.
 * 
 * Helps to avoid calling Wire.begin() multiple times (which is not)
 * entirely benign as it reinitialises).
 * 
 * Also helps to avoid the Wire clock from being set, by another device
 * driver, to a speed which is higher than a device supports.
 * 
 * Thirdly, it provides a convenient way to check whether there is a 
 * device on a particular I2C address.
